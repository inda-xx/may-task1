Create a simple game with a character named Ken that sings. Ken's song is "I'm just Ken". Your task is to implement methods to introduce Ken, make him sing and evaluate his performance.

The required methods to implement are:

- `void introduce()`: This method will print the message "I'm Ken, and I'm going to sing a song for you!".
  
- `void sing()`: This method will print the lyrics of the Ken's song "I'm just Ken.".

- `int evaluatePerformance()`: This method will rate Ken's performance randomly. Ken's rating is a random integer number between 0 (worst performance) and 10 (best performance). The number should be returned by the method.

Implement these methods in a class named `Ken`.

Also, please write a `main` method that introduces Ken, makes him sing, and evaluates his performance three times.
